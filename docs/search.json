While I see problems through a lens of interdependence and complexity, I am an advocate of accesible and reproducible research.\nCurrently, I am working on my Master thesis on the Predictive ability of centrality measures in multi-layer networks at the department of Methodology and Statistics. You can find more information on my past and present projects in the Showcase section."
