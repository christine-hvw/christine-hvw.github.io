As part of the ERC project FAST: Fostering social tipping dynamics to accelerate sustainability transitions I aim to contribute to a more sustainable future by employing quantitative models of societal processes.\nI hold a Master’s degree in Methodology & Statistics from Utrecht University, where I investigated the Predictive ability of centrality measures in multi-layer networks for my thesis project.\nWhile I see problems through a lens of interdependence and complexity, I am an advocate of accessible and reproducible research. You can find more information on my past and present projects in the Showcase section."
