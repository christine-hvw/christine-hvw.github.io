<div style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">

I am a graduate student at Utrecht University trying to make sense of society with the help of statistical methods. While I see problems through a lens of interdependence and complexity, I am an advocate of accessible and reproducible research.

Currently, I am working on my Master thesis on the *Predictive ability of centrality measures in multi-layer networks* at the department of [Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics). You can find more information on my past and present projects in the [Showcase](showcase.qmd) section.

<i class="bi bi-info-circle"></i><span style="color:Tomato;"> I am open to work </span> from spring/summer 2023. I am interested in PhD positions on statistical methods and Data Scientist roles. Please get in touch if you have an opportunity for me.
