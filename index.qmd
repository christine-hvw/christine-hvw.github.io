<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right:-50px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">

I am a PhD Candidate at Eindhoven University of Technology within the [Technology, Innovation & Society](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/innovation-sciences/technology-innovation-society) group at the department of Industrial Engineering and Innovation Sciences. As part of the ERC project *FAST: Fostering social tipping dynamics to accelerate sustainability transitions* I aim to contribute to a more sustainable future by employing quantitative models of societal processes.

I hold a Master's degree in Methodology & Statistics from Utrecht University, where I investigated the *Predictive ability of centrality measures in multi-layer networks* for my thesis project. 

While I see problems through a lens of interdependence and complexity, I am an advocate of accessible and reproducible research. You can find more information on my past and present projects in the [Showcase](showcase.qmd) section.

I like sharing my expertise in statistical analysis, visualization, and R programming. Please reach out if you think your work could benefit from a <span style="color: indianred">consultation or collaboration</span>!
